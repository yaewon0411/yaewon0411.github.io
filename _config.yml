          This project was implemented using YOLO v3,
          It aims to be used as a recognition program where wearing safety equipment is mandatory.
          If there is a visible difference in the accident rate depending on the use of the recognition program in the field,
          Statistics based on this are expected to improve the maintenance of related systems and on-site safety awareness for mandatory wearing of safety equipment.
